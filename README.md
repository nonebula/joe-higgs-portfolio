# joe-higgs-portfolio
This is my professional portfolio that communicates my experience, skill and expertise in Web Development for future roles and my career. 

## Description 
The goal of this project is to deliver a high-quality one-page website for myself, Joe Higgs. The intention is to promote myself to potential clients and employers in order to secure employment. As I continue to grow and develop within this field, I will continue to update it and demonstrate my skills through projects that I will add to the portfolio. The priority was to ensure effective use of html and css elements to construct a page which functions as intended. By applying my skills in these fields, I have been able to fully construct the page without any functionality issues. I have also taken time to extensively comment the .html and .css files so my work is understood.
